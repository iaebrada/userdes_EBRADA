                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>Hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Ismael Ebrada, currently studying in Asia Pacific College. Im 19 years old and only son in my family.
<br>I graduated junior high in Don Bosco Technical college and my Senior high here in Asia Pacific College. Growing up as a kid,
<br><br>I dreamt of being an Engineer that's why my parents chose Don bosco during my junior high year, when I was about to enter college 
<br>my dreams of being an Engineer became gray, so I chose IT and planned to stay here in APC. As a student of APC since SHS i can say
<br>that APC can really mold you and help you to excel in your academics. During my senior high year in APC, i wasn't sure enough on
<br>what course should i choose in college, but thanks to this school because they were able to help me find my passion and that's about
<br>computer, so I chose IT as my course here. 
<br>
<br>Growing up as the only son in my family, I tend to spend my summer vacation with my family and friends.
<br>Last month, we were in Batangas to spend our vacation together with my family. During summer, I tend to play basketball a lot
<br>with my friends, and play video games with them when we're bored. I also workout during summer because I really want to become
<br>active during these days and I dont want to get fat that's why im trying my best to become healthy.
<br>
<br>Lastly, I expect to learn the basic fundamentals of User Design and Programming. I also expect that our professor will guide and help us through out the semester.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hello there everyone, im here to present you my favorite application which is grab.
<br>Can you imagine yourself stuck in a place where you can’t see any vehicles or mode of transportation, well with this application you can now book a ride with the type of car you want easier, safer and convenient. <br><br>Grab is a Singapore-based technology that offers transport services, food delivery and payment solutions. This application is not just about transportation and all. It also comes with a food deliver that covers all the restaurants here in the Philippines. If you feel lazy enough or having some hard time to visit a mall, you can book grabfood, then you will be able to pick the food that you want from any restaurants or fast food chain in our country. Also, this application has its payment methods and now you can go and be cashless with its own grabpay. You can also use your other cards as a payment for your ride. See its easy and convenient. <br>
<br>I discovered this application with some of my friends back in high school, then I started to download this app, and use it as my mode of transportation when I really can’t find any transportation in the place that I'm in.

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">As an IT student, this question will test our creativity and our strategy in building or making this kind of elevator. It will be much simpler if will break down our strategy and planning for the elevator. Are we talking about a single elevator that can cover all the 1000 floors or a multiple elevators that will only run on specific floors like even and odd numbers just like in our school. Second question, is it a company, shopping mall, hospital or any other building? <br><br>A 1000 floor is just so big and could possibly covers the whole city around. Let’s just assume that this building is a multi-national company, so if this building is a multi-national building many people would go around here, this place would be busy, and lot of people are going thru elevators to reach to their specific place. I think a single elevator that has 1000 buttons for each floor, 2 buttons for door open and close, 2 buttons for emergencies, and a multiple of switches for the maintenance operations would not work on this one. <br><br>If people would pass this elevator every day, the buttons of the elevator would be likely to worn out just like the buttons in our school. Button light would likely to be busted because a lot of people are pressing the buttons every single day. Also, a 1000 floor elevator would have 1000 buttons, so there will be 1 to 1000 buttons to press with a single person. This would be so hard for the person if he/she is in a hurry. How about people who are mistakenly press the wrong and they must wait for the elevator to stop, this will be a much bigger issue when the button grid is more than 10 times of its normal size. 
<br><br>I found out a better solution on this one, so if pressing out all the floors doesn’t work, here’s my solution on this problem. Technology is around us; we are using it in our daily basis. Nowadays, we are in era wherein our gadgets our just touchscreens, and we don’t have to press the keypads anymore, we just need to press the screens of our phones and it will work. Why can’t we apply this kind of technology on this problem? Via a touchscreen or a keypad just like in our cellphones, atm machine, big screen in malls etc. We can use it as an alternative as a solution on this one, its just a simple 12 buttons have 0-9 numbers and you can type the floor that you want to go, and press “go”. <br>A lcd screen that shows the clear visualization of the floors that elevator is going to. Pressing “go” on the lcd screen will give you a representation of the floor that you’re currently in. Also, there will be a door open and close buttons, so that users will not find some time to find the opening and close pad of the elevator. This lcd screen will help people to type their specific floor as easy as possible. If a person typed a wrong number, there is also a “x” keypad so that they can press that keypad and type again their floor number. In case of emergency, it has an alarm button and maintenance button for some safety cases. Lastly, it has also a screen that could display the floor  you’re currently in and floors that is passing by the elevator. &nbsp;<br></p>

<br>
<br><strong>Objectives:</strong> 
<br>•	To provide service to the condo unit owners 
<br>•	To help segregate wastes coming from condo units 
<br>Problems: 
<br>•	Majority of Condo owners nowadays do not have a time to clean their condo units 
<br>•	Unsegregated Wastes coming from different condo units. 
<br>Propose Project: 
<br>•	An Online Booking application that lets the user to book for a certain people to clean their condo units. 
<br>•	This application is a bridge of two entities; the Cleaning Service Provider agencies and Condo Unit Owners or simply the Customers. 
<br>•	The people that will be hired by the cleaning service provider agencies will be trained to know how to properly segregate the waste coming from the condo units. 
<br>•	This application will generate profit in terms of advertisements. 
<br>•	This application will give customers the ability to choose from which company to prioritize using rate system. 
<br>•	This application can negate false booking. 
<br>Related Applications: 
<br>•	Grab 
<br>•	Angkas 
<br>Those applications are related to our proposed project because it also books people to do service to the customer but in terms of transportation. 
<br>•GoodWork.ph 
<br>This is a very similar application to our proposed project because it also offers home cleaning service but the difference of our proposed project is that it only allows user to use one specific condo unit address because in goodwork.ph user can book a cleaning service anywhere wherein the safety of the people who cleans and users/customer are at risk. User can also use it for pranking someone or fake booking. 
<br>Our proposed project is connected to different service provider agencies that offers cleaning service. &nbsp;<br></p>
